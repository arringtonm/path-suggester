<!--



  Is form as important to you as functionality? (front end vs back end)

    a. I am strongly concerned with aesthetics and user experience. (+design)
    b. I prefer to focus on the heavy-lifting "underneath the hood" (+csharp, php)
    c. I want to control the entire user experience, front and back (+ruby)


  When you think of starting a new project...

    a. I want to build the app I've been thinking about (+java, +ruby)
    b. I think of the look and feel and branding
    c. I start working out the functionality first, I can make it pretty later (-design, +php, +csharp)


  Do you feel more comfortable working with established companies or prefer to work with a startup? (big v small)

    a. I would like to work for the big players. (+csharp, +java, )
    b. I want to get in at the ground floor and help grow a company. (+ruby)



Are you drawn to the cutting edge or the tried and true?

    a. I am an early adopter and want to stay up on the new trends.
    b. I prefer to work with what has proven to be reliable and lasting.
    c. I could go either way - I want to work with what is now.




A great interface and design is fundamental to a great project.
